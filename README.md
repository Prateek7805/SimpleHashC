# SimpleHashC  
C program to Read file named "plainText.txt" and produce 1byte hash using Column-wise Xor.  
The code converts the input text from the file "plainText.txt" into binary  
and arranges the bits into a 2D matrix of column size = numbers of bits in the hash(8bits in this case)  
The code then performs column-wise xor of the bits and then saves the hash into a file "hash.txt"
